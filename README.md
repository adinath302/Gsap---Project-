GSAP Project: Creative Web Animations📄 OverviewThis repository hosts a project that demonstrates advanced web animations and interactive user experiences utilizing the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP), a high-performance JavaScript animation library, and the ScrollTrigger plugin for scroll-based effects.The goal of this project is to showcase smooth, cross-browser, and performance-optimized animations synchronized with the user's scroll position.✨ FeaturesHigh-Performance Animations: Uses GSAP's core engine for buttery-smooth animations at 60fps.Scroll-Driven Effects: Implements ScrollTrigger to pin sections, create parallax effects, and trigger animations based on scroll position.Sequential Animation Control: Utilizes GSAP Timelines for precise control and sequencing of multiple tweens.Modern Web Stack: Built with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.🛠️ Technologies UsedHTML5 & CSS3JavaScript (ES6+)GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): The core animation library.ScrollTrigger Plugin: For creating scroll-based interactions.Remix Icon: Used for scalable vector icons.🚀 Getting StartedFollow these steps to set up and run the project locally.PrerequisitesYou need a modern web browser to view the project. No external node environment is strictly required if you only intend to view the final output.Installation & SetupClone the Repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/adinath302/Gsap---Project-.git

📜 Key GSAP ConceptsThis project likely makes use of the following GSAP methods and concepts:Method/ConceptDescriptiongsap.to()Animates an element to a specified set of properties from its current state.gsap.from()Animates an element from a specified set of properties to its current state.gsap.timeline()Sequences multiple tweens together for complex, controlled animation flows.ScrollTriggerSynchronizes any GSAP animation with the scrollbar, enabling complex scroll effects.
